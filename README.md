# Document-Denoising-using-CycleGAN
Built a CycleGAN-based deep learning model for document denoising and restoration. The project restores scanned documents by removing noise and artifacts, improving readability and OCR performance. Applied adversarial, cycle-consistency, and identity losses to train generators and discriminators.
